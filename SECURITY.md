# Security Guidelines for eWegen BFF

This document outlines security practices and procedures for the eWegen BFF service.

## Security Practices

### Dependency Management

1. **Regular Security Audits**
   ```bash
   # Run security audit
   npm run security:audit
   
   # Fix vulnerabilities automatically
   npm run security:fix
   
   # Check for outdated packages
   npm run security:check
   ```

2. **Dependency Overrides**
   - Use `overrides` in package.json to force secure versions
   - Example: `"form-data": "^4.0.4"` to override vulnerable versions

3. **Automated Security Scanning**
   - CI/CD pipeline includes security audit step
   - Docker images are scanned with Trivy
   - Static analysis with SonarCloud

### Code Security

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use helmet.js for security headers
   - Implement rate limiting

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Use AWS Cognito for authentication
   - Implement proper session management
   - Validate JWT tokens

3. **Error Handling**
   - Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
   - Log security events appropriately
   - Use proper HTTP status codes

## Security Incident Response

### Reporting Security Issues

1. **For Critical Issues**
   - Create a security advisory in GitHub
   - Tag with appropriate severity level
   - Include detailed reproduction steps

2. **For Non-Critical Issues**
   - Create a regular issue with security label
   - Provide context and impact assessment

### Response Process

1. **Immediate Actions**
   ```bash
   # Check for vulnerabilities
   npm audit
   
   # Update dependencies
   npm update
   
   # Run tests to ensure nothing is broken
   npm test
   ```

2. **Documentation**
   - Update this security document
   - Document the fix and prevention measures
   - Update team on security practices

## Security Tools

### Development Tools

- **ESLint**: Code quality and security checks
- **npm audit**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **SonarCloud**: Static code analysis

### CI/CD Security

- **GitHub Actions**: Automated security scanning
- **Trivy**: Container vulnerability scanning
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   - Regularly update all dependencies
   - Monitor security advisories
   - Use automated tools for dependency management

2. **Secure Configuration**
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Don't commit secrets to version control
   - Use secure defaults

3. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Log security events
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Set up alerts for security issues

4. **Access Control**
   - Implement least privilege principle
   - Use strong authentication
   - Regular access reviews

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Run `npm audit` before each release
- [ ] Update dependencies regularly
- [ ] Review security headers
- [ ] Validate all inputs
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Monitor security logs
